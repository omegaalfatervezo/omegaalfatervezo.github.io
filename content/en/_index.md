I was born in Debrecen, completed my schooling here, then studied in Budapest and graduated in 1997 with a degree in mechanical engineering from Bánki Donát University of Technology. I stayed in the field and worked at tool manufacturing companies on the production line. In early 2000, I founded my own company, whose legal successor has been operating since 2013. Over the years, I have engaged in various activities within the profession, such as CNC programming, CAD design, modification and maintenance support design, 3D scanning, reverse engineering, and 3D printing engineering. I also obtained an electronics technician qualification in 2025 to expand my professional expertise.

Our company operates in Debrecen and undertakes custom and small-series plastic product manufacturing using 3D printing, 3D scanning, and the design and manufacturing of thermoforming tools. Cooperative work can also be completed with our partners by leveraging appropriate business relationships.

If you have questions regarding design and manufacturing, I hope you will find the answers in the [questions](/en/questions) menu section.
